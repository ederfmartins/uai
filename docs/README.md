# UAI

# History

The idea of writing my own language starts a long time ago. Last year, after a good lunch, my friends and I was chatting about some problems that our favourite programming languages have. At some point we started to troll PHP, which caused one of my colleagues to get upset and ask me why I did not make my own language (he is not an engineer and PHP was the only language he knew). Two days later I came up with a simple REPL able to execute some basic expressions. He then suggested that this "new language" must be called uai. 
 
Uai is a kind of interjection commonly used by people of Minas Gerais, my homeland. Uai can mean astonishment, doubt, agreement and so its a perfect name for a program language.

# Purpose

Uai is a general purpose language like C and Python. The idea is writing a statically typed language, that is friendly to the developer, without losing it ability to go low level. Thus, Uai can became a good system language.

Another main use case of Uai will be writing fast, scalable and maintainable machine learning powered APIs.

# Features

* C like syntax 
* Able to compile to machine code
* Statically typed
* Type inference
* C ABI compatible (to be easly integrated with other languages)

coming soon

* Native support to web server development
* Native support to scientific computing
* Multiprocessing (Go like?)
* AsyncIO (?)
* Exceptions / operator overload / generic types
* Optional garbage collector


# Syntax

Currently Uai is a simple arithmetic expression parser. It has support to solve common 32 bit integer, double and boolean expressions.
